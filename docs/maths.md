# Maths

### Objective

The objective of this document is to capture an idea of what the maths for an incremental game would or could involve. 

At its core, incremental math happens something similar to this

<a name="Maths-1">Maths-1</a>

```(b * bx + bi)^(exb * exm + exi) * tm + ti```

The above formula uses the following variables:
- b: base value
- bi: static increase for base value before exponents
- bx: base multiplier
- exb: base exponent value
- exm: exponent multiplier
- exi: static increase for exponents
- tm: total multiplier
- ti: static increase for total


## Stats

For stats, the [Maths-1](#Maths-1) formula will be used.

## Skills
For stats, the [Maths-1](#Maths-1) formula will be used.

### Efficiency
For stats, the [Maths-1](#Maths-1) formula will be used.

## Thing per Thing

For Thing per Thing (like Kill per Kill), use a different formula (TBD)
