# Game App

This is the game application. It is a trial and error attempt at the following:

- Build a database containing
    - user
    - experience
    - last log in time
- Build a game server
    - Calculates experience as time passed
- Build a game user interface
    - Displays experience gained for each user 
- Deploying an app in a Docker Container
- Deploying to AWS (stretch goal)
